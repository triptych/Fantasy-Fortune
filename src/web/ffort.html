          Welcome to Allaria! My name is Crystal, and I'll be your guide in this world. 
          Until a few months ago, Allaria was under the rule of an evil Sorcerer named Pyrus.
          A band of heroes went on a quest to defeat Pyrus, with the help of an ancient book 
          called The Word. The Word was an ancient book of prophecy that was so powerful, it was
          magically alive. There was a dreadful battle, and in order to finally defeat Pyrus, The Word
          sacrificed itself - destroying both itself and Pyrus. Its pages were scattered throughout the 
          land of Allaria. The book was so powerful that even now, when someone finds a page from the book,
          it will magically foretell something about that person's day.
        </p>  
        <p>This is where you come in, adventurer! Your quest is to travel the world of Allaria and fetch back all of the
          pages of The Word. Our magicians hope that if we are able to retrieve every page that was lost, we might be able to
          restore The Word to its original state.  There are a lot of residual monsters, dungeons, mercenaries, and other baddies
          left over from Pyrus' rule, that will stand in your way. Be strong, be brave, and most of all have fun!
          </p>
